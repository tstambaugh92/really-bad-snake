# Really Bad Snake
This is the first game created by The Church of the Christ Hawk's game division.
Code was all done by Hawkmaster Thomas Stambaugh, other credits are in the credits.txt file.

# Installing
You need to have Python 3 installed on your system to use this. After installing Python, also install the PyGame package that this game uses. No other special libraries should be required. 

Once install, the command should be similar on all three supported operating systems. Do note, I do not have a Mac to test Mac OS right now.
>python main.py

Or
>python ./src/main.py

Depending on which folder you are running from. There is a one line batch file to double click and run if you are using Windows if you prefer running from explorer. There is an icon.ico file in the img folder if you wish to make a shortcut, or an icon.png if your system doesn't support ico files.

# Playing
To begin the game from the Title Screen, either click on the Play button, or simply hit the space bar. 

WASD are used for Up/Left/Down/Right respectively.

If you are in the Credits or the Exiting Game cutscene, the space bar will skip the cutscenes.

# Settings
Difficulty:
- Nesting is the easiest difficulty. Your Snake starts slow and increases speed every 50 points.
- Knighthawk is the normal difficulty. Your Snake starts at a decent speed, increasing every 40 points.
- Hawkmaster is the hard difficulty. Your Snake starts at a higher speed, and increases every 30 points.

Gore:
This disables the story acurate title screen if the Snake ever dies during Gameplay. 

Sound:
This will mute all the sound in the game. Note that having sound off will also skip the Death cutscene, allowing you to get back to the game faster.

Full Screen:
Toggles full screen on or off. Note that it will change your monitor resolution temporarily, causing some windows to be a different size when closing the game. 

# Special Thanks
